This Rimworld mod adds some extra item categories, so that you can set up stockpiles more easily:
- things which need to be indoors
- things which need refrigeration

When you're setting up stockpiles, they'll appear as top-level categories, near the bottom.
They don't have any sub-categories, so you'll have to scroll through everything if you want to get specific.
(Or use the normal categories - when you checkmark one of the new categories, it affects the normal categories too!)

Note that this doesn't work on meats or corpses.
I believe this is because those are hard-coded, rather than being defined in XML.
